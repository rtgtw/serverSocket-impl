Project Idea: Cloud File Transfer / Authentication service

The goal of this project is to learn moer about the file transfer process using sockets,
implement a time based one time password authentication system TOTP for authenticating with the server,
and a basic gui for the clients to share their files with the server. I also want there to be a basic
database to store the files
